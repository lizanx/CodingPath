The Concept of CPU Performance Scaling

The majority of modern processors are capable of operating in a number of different clock frequency and voltage configurations, often referred to as Operating Performance Points or P-states (in ACPI terminology). As a rule, the higher the clock frequency and the higher the voltage, the more instructions can be retired by the CPU over a unit of time, but also the higher the clock frequency and the higher the voltage, the more energy is consumed over a unit of time (or the more power is drawn) by the CPU in the given P-state. Therefore there is a natural tradeoff between the CPU capacity (the number of instructions that can be executed over a unit of time) and the power drawn by the CPU.

In some situations it is desirable or even necessary to run the program as fast as possible and then there is no reason to use any P-states different from the highest one (i.e. the highest-performance frequency/voltage configuration available). In some other cases, however, it may not be necessary to execute instructions so quickly and maintaining the highest available CPU capacity for a relatively long time without utilizing it entirely may be regarded as wasteful. It also may not be physically possible to maintain maximum CPU capacity for too long for thermal or power supply capacity reasons or similar. To cover those cases, there are hardware interfaces allowing CPUs to be switched between different frequency/voltage configurations or (in the ACPI terminology) to be put into different P-states.

Typically, they are used along with algorithms to estimate the required CPU capacity, so as to decide which P-states to put the CPUs into. Of course, since the utilization of the system generally changes over time, that has to be done repeatedly on a regular basis. The activity by which this happens is referred to as CPU performance scaling or CPU frequency scaling (because it involves adjusting the CPU clock frequency).

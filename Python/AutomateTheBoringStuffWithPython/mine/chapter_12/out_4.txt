It was hardly a year since they had come to live at Tipton Grange with

their uncle, a man nearly sixty, of acquiescent temper, miscellaneous

opinions, and uncertain vote. He had travelled in his younger years,

and was held in this part of the county to have contracted a too

rambling habit of mind. Mr. Brookeâ€™s conclusions were as difficult to

predict as the weather: it was only safe to say that he would act with

benevolent intentions, and that he would spend as little money as

possible in carrying them out. For the most glutinously indefinite

minds enclose some hard grains of habit; and a man has been seen lax

about all his own interests except the retention of his snuff-box,

concerning which he was watchful, suspicious, and greedy of clutch.
